An attempt to model a semantic space as described in ```Derrac, J., & Schockaert, S. (2014, August). Characterising Semantic Relatedness using Interpretable Directions in Conceptual Spaces. In ECAI (pp. 243-248).```

As opposed to Schockaert's approach to modelling the semantic space, the current method used sentence-wide context to model environmental-relatedness (object often occurring in similar environments).
